# DupeChecker Chat Triggers Module

Note: the ONLY part accessed from the .jar file is the getItemData function, 
All other functions are not being run by this module.

The full source code is open for the public eye to see, every little part is accessable by everyone.

## How to run the module:

In-Game: run the command '/ct files' (ChatTriggers must be installed!)

After downloading the zip file, take the extracted folder and place it inside the modules folder inside the folder that was opened from ChatTriggers.

Type '/ct reload' in game to load the module.
If the chat says: "Dupechecker loaded!" it was successfully initialized.

Now you can type '/dupecheck' with your item in your hand to check if it is suspected to be duped.
