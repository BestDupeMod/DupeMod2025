# DupeChecker Mod For Forge 1.8.9
- This is folder contains the source code of "dupechecker-1.0.jar" used inside the CT module.

Compiled jar from this folder can be used as a standalone mod AS LONG AS the correct version of java 8 is installed.

### Standalone installation:

**Note: those steps are only required while using the official minecraft launcher, other launchers such as modrinth already have the latest version of Java8 installed**

The normal forge 1.8.9 installation does not use the latest build version of Java 8.

In order to update the Java version, click on 'Installations' in the Minecraft Launcher, click on the three dots on and then edit, and under 'More Options' set the Java Executable select a newer version of javaw.exe and run the new version.
